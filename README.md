# Comparing Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms using Atari Tennis

In recent years, there is a lot of active research happening in the field of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to address efficiency-related concerns. Efficiency is very important for any RL algorithm as
it will determine how well the agent behaves in unknown scenarios or the real world. The objective
of this project is to compare the efficiencies of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,
namely, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy approximation (PPO), Rainbow, and Soft-
Actor critic in solving the Atari tennis environment.
